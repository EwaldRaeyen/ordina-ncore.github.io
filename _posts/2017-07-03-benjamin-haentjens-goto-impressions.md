>When my boss offered me to go to the GOTO conference, I eagerly accepted. It's one of the most reputable developer conferences in the neighborhood, with a steady following. I must say, the reputation is well earned.
I arrived in sunny shiny busy Amsterdam after a long 3 hour drive with my co-worker. We had to leave very early in the morning to arrive on time despite unpredictable traffic. Once we saw the awesome conference venue, the Beurs van Berlage, all fatigue left our bodies and we went in to join the hubbub of like-minded people inside. The welcoming and distribution of ticket pendants was very well organized, and a healthy breakfast was provided in the common area. Immediately we got to talking with professional colleagues about what tracks looked interesting and how we would apply them once we got back to the dailies.
A big gong sounded the start of the first session, and what a kick-off session it was.The renowned Chris Valasek from the Uber company talked us through the current state of automotive security. Mr Valasek is a highly energetic speaker, and I'm sure that if the morning coffee hadn't done its job, he would have. The unfamiliarity of the topic made it all the more intriguing to me. After that, it was time to make some hard, definitive choices about which sessions to follow.
The subtitle of the conference was "Digital Transformation, Privacy & Security", a good choice given the available tracks:
•	Cloud native
•	Unhackable
•	IT & society
•	Machine learning without a PhD
•	Solutions tuesday
I went mostly for sessions along the unhackable track, and these are my highlights:

Adrian Mouat – Applied microservices security
Well, maybe a better title would have been 'applied docker security', but it was still a great talk. Mr Mouat pointed out a bunch of easy ways to better your docker security in small steps. He laid them out very clear, and I picked up a high density of quick wins.

Dan North – How to break the rules
I think everyone who has seen him talk can agree that Dan North is a great captivating speaker, no matter the subject. Unfortunately this translated in a quite overfilled room. Even though there were no more chairs, I decided to stay and listen, and I'm glad I did. Mr North clarified what you need to do to make a digital transformation succeed, and what questions to ask before you commit to one. I'm convinced every manager should see this talk, I definitely learned some lessons.

Jaya Baloo – Surveillance and cryptography
One of the few female speakers, but a superb talk. With every sentence I was more and more convinced that Mrs Baloo knew very well what she was talking about. She sketched the future of cryptography so compelling and well-informed, I felt as if I had lived it. It was pretty scary though.

Social event
After day one, we gathered all in special place nearby: Bar Heffer. Yes, there was alcohol, but the sense of camaraderie and the willingness to help each other brought out the best in all present. We had great discussion about microservices and async patterns, chatted with speakers, learned about other cultures (visit a Polish wedding!). I'm sure I'm not the only one who made new friends there. Who knew developers could be so social?

Poorna Kallare - Internet of healthcare things
Not an experienced speaker, but definitely one to touch on some key benefits of a microservices architecture I had not contemplated yet, all in the context of high-quality medical software practical use-cases.

Ben Stopford – Rethinking microservices with stateful streams
I've never done stateful streams before, but the talk by Mr Stopford was an open invitation to look into them. He showed a practical implementation with Kafka that seemed like a really nice architecture. I do have to learn more about this topic.

Anyways, it was a wonderful conference, and they do have some nice free and publicly available sessions online, do check it out: https://www.youtube.com/user/GotoConferences
