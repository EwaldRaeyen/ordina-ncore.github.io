<h2 class="major">NCore in a nutshell...</h2>
<p>Our .NET department (<span class="accentuate">NCore</span>) is doing more than well. With different beautiful references and a constant stream of challenging projects, we can say that our .NET developers are always giving <span class="accentuate">the best</span> of themselves in their jobs and that we are the best .NET club out there. In addition, we are an open team. You may know us from VISUG or Techorama. We consider it important to <span class="accentuate">invest</span> in a community of professionals and we are not afraid to show it. Internally we are also organized: flat structure, very accessible, lots of room for initiative, thorough distribution of responsibility. Making sure the team is well. Rolled up sleeves. That kind of approach. Just because our <span class="accentuate">.NET</span> club is doing so well, we are looking for new cool colleagues!</p>
